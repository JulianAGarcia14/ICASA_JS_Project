Erdos Reyni:
N vertices
Connected with probability P
Number of edges: n = P*N(N-1)/2

Implement:
Give a number of vertices
Give a probability
For every node:
	Roll the dice that its connected to another node
	If successful connect those nodes and add to edge count
	Repeat for all other seperate node
Afterwards compare edge count to result of equation to make sure
network is built correctly
-----------------------------------------------------
Barbasi-Albert:
Begins with an initial network of m0 nodes
Nodes are added one at a time
Each new node connected to m<=m0 nodes 
Pi is the probability that the new node is connected to node i
Ki is the degree of node i
Equation:
Pi = Ki / SUMOFALLNODES(Ki)

Implement:
Begin with set network (create an erdos reyni)
Begin adding nodes up to a set number
As each node is created, do the following:
	Calculate chance its connected to another node
	Roll that dice then connect if successful
	Do this for all other pre-existing nodes
